We analyzed 2 cSV files provided with schools and students informstion from a school district. We made a lot of calculations from the data to extract the relevant parts and tried to find correlation between various factors and how students performed in Math and Reading.


We can draw following conclusions based on the Scores calculated based on School Type and School Size
 	
* Charter schools have a much better Passing % in both Math and Reading than District Schools.
* Large Schools with 2000-5000 students have a much lower passing % than small or medium schools.

One interesting observation was that having higher average per student budget in schools, the overall Passing % was lower. 

Based on grade wise analysis of the scores, there is no improvement in any of the schools in the district.
